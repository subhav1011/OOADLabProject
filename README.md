As part of the Object Oriented Analysis and Design in Software Engineering Course we were asked to do a project that entailed building a software from scratch
using the basis fundamentals of Software Engineering. 

This Repository contains the code for our implementation of the software, which is an online shopping system, using JAVA and XML in Android Studio. The Code can be downloaded directly, opened and then built in Android Studio.

Reports in relation to the Software Design have also been uploaded, feel free to take a look!
